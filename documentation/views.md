##Edit Text Fields

the id naming convention uses the API naming convention plus an underscore plus `editText`. so for the manufacturer name you end up with an id `manufacturerName_editText`.

each edit text view will have a hint inside of it *and* a label above the text field so that even when the hint goes away the user can see what field they're editing.
