##Oauth

* user registration on database

* local persistance of authorization token

##CRUD

* build an about/credits page so we can attribute icons

* Begin adding landscape layouts to current functional views

Definitely estimated all the cards this sprint, but our estimation numbers were way off. Some were wildly too high or low for the actual task. Change to using the linking process on jira to make everything we can a demo-able story card. Tackle an entire card as a team, rather than spread out over several cards. Pre-demo card reviews after the code freeze.

Jira is not so much a blocker, but maybe our technical debt in using jira. Which is an improvement, we can see a way out with the tool and using the jira board. We still want a fourth column (Backlog-WIP-DEMO-READY-DONE-DONE), and a dedicated scrum master, beer for every lunch, 8 gigs of ram, a ram (office pet) named Eight Gigs. Unknown errors from the database, or from our database connection.
